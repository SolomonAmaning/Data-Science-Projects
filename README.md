This is a project on telecom customers churn prediction .
Lasso-regression was applied for feature selection
churn(1) and no churn(0) were modelled and predicted using logistic regression, random forest, adaboost and neural network. Random forest was the best classfier giving good classification report compared to the other algorithms.
